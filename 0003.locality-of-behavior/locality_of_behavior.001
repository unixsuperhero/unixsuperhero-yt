I want to record a bunch of videos about software principles and practices.  Separation is going to be a prominent, recurring topic.  However, I already know that some prime fanboy is going to comment, "i prefer locality of behavior instead of separation".  For all the parrots out there, this video is for you.

Everytime the subject of separation comes up, the primeagen will say that he prefers locality of behavior over separation.  however, these 2 ideas are not mutually exclusive.  i hope to explain that by the end of this video.
Here is his official definition, "The behaviour of a unit of code should be as obvious as possible by looking only at that unit of code".
